# Predictive Network Telemetry System

An SDN-based monitoring system that uses LSTM/GRU networks and Reinforcement Learning to move from reactive to **proactive** network telemetry. Instead of polling at a fixed rate, the system predicts congestion before it happens and only activates high-fidelity monitoring when it's needed.

## Project Goals

The core idea is **Predictive Activation** — the system operates in two modes:

- **Heartbeat mode** (every 30s): Default low-overhead polling. Used when the LSTM predicts less than 70% chance of congestion.
- **Intensive mode** (every 1s): High-fidelity polling. Triggered when the LSTM predicts 70%+ congestion probability.

A Reinforcement Learning agent learns *when* to switch between these modes, balancing three competing objectives via the reward function:

```
Reward = -(Monitoring_Cost) - α(Congestion_Penalty) + β(Detection_Accuracy)
```

The target is to match the detection accuracy of always-on intensive polling while reducing monitoring overhead by 60% or more.

## Tech Stack

Every component has been audited for mutual compatibility on **Python 3.12.10**. Here are the key choices and why we made them.

| Layer | Technology | Version | Notes |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Runtime | Python | `3.12.10` | Broad ML library support; security patches through Oct 2028 |
| Infrastructure | AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 22.04) | Jammy | Team is on Windows/Mac — Mininet requires Linux kernel namespaces |
| Network Emulation | Mininet | `2.3.1b4` | Install from source on 22.04 |
| SDN Controller | **os-ken** | `3.1.1` | Maintained Ryu fork — see note below |
| Virtual Switch | Open vSwitch | `2.17.9` | OpenFlow 1.3, from Ubuntu default repos |
| Deep Learning | PyTorch | `2.10.0` | LSTM/GRU congestion prediction |
| Reinforcement Learning | Stable Baselines3 | `2.7.1` | DQN/PPO agent for telemetry decisions |
| Anomaly Detection | Scikit-learn | `1.6.1` | DBSCAN clustering |
| Dashboard | Streamlit | `1.54.0` | Real-time comparison of reactive vs. predictive |

### Why os-ken instead of Ryu?

Ryu is unmaintained (last release: May 2020) and **broken on Python 3.12** — it depends on `distutils`, `asynchat`, and `ssl.wrap_socket()`, all of which were removed in 3.12. os-ken is OpenStack's actively maintained fork with a near-identical API. Migration from any Ryu code or tutorial is a namespace find-and-replace:

```python
# Ryu (broken)                        # os-ken (works)
from ryu.base import app_manager  →   from os_ken.base import app_manager
from ryu.controller import ofp_event  →   from os_ken.controller import ofp_event
```

### Why PyTorch over TensorFlow?

Stable Baselines3 is built on PyTorch — it's a hard dependency (`torch>=2.3.0`). Using TensorFlow would mean abandoning SB3 or installing both frameworks. PyTorch also has broader Python 3.12 support and dominates the modern RL ecosystem.

## Development Roadmap (15 Weeks)

| Phase | Weeks | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **1 — Infrastructure** | 5-6 | EC2 environment, Mininet + os-ken setup, data collection pipeline |
| **2 — Prediction** | 7-8 | LSTM/GRU model training (target: >85% accuracy) |
| **3 — Decision Engine** | 9-10 | RL agent: environment, reward function, training |
| **4 — Integration** | 11-13 | Close the loop: predictor → RL agent → os-ken controller |
| **5 — Demo** | 14–15 | Streamlit dashboard, baseline comparisons, final report |
